## Description

Hi! Welcome to this repository. My name is Milena, and this is my first GitHub repo. Here i practice my skills at whritting markdown texts, LaTeX formulas and other intresting things like that.

## My favourite university subjects

#### Currently my favourite subjects are:

1.Fundamentals of Artificial Intelligence  

2.Algorithmization and programming

3.Analytical Geometry

## Online VS Offline Studying 

#### Here is what i think about each of the studying options: 


|Online | Offline |
|--------|---------|
|You can sleept more; No need to commute; there is no need communacate with people in person; study anywhere and anytime; | You can hang out with your pals; |

## My favourite math formulas 

#### Here are some ofmy favourite math formulas: 

,- Area of a treangle 

$$
S=\frac{1}{2}ah
$$

,- Pythagorean theorem

$$

a^2+b^2=c^2

$$

,- Discriminant

$$
D = b^2 - 4ac
$$

$$
x_{1} = \frac{-b + \sqrt{D}}{2a}
$$

$$
x_{2} = \frac{-b - \sqrt{D}}{2a}
$$

## My coding skills 

#### I am skilled enougch to do some coding - here is one of the exsamples: 

```c++
cout <<"Hello, GitHub!" <<endl;
```
Use the [web-compiler](https://cpp.sh/?source=%23include+%3Ciostream%3E%0D%0Ausing+namespace+std%3B+%0D%0A%0D%0Aint+main+()+%7B%0D%0A++++cout+%3C%3C+%22Hello%2C+GitHub%22%3C%3Cendl%3B+%0D%0A++++return+0%3B%0D%0A%7D%0D%0A) to check the code out, the ```main()``` function prints "Hello, GitHub!" message. 

## The image i like 

#### This is the place i have visited and it gives me a feeling of calm and admiration for the beauty of nature.
